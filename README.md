Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is for showcasing some of the Machine Learning skills to potential companies or possible project collaborators. 

The main goal of this project is also to document my learning process for getting into Data Science topic. 
The data is all publically availible dataset and the evaluations of the data is done based on a combination of online courses and adopting 
the skills to other public data.
